# Mongodb and Jest Testing

How to test code that uses mongodb as storage.

## Description

I have created a `UserService` class which interacts with mongodb for `creating`, `retrieving`, `updating` and `deleting` resources in `users` collection. So in this repository explore different ways of testing the functionality of that service.

## Development

- `yarn` or `npm` installed.
- Latest `nodejs` installed.

### Run

In order to run tests locally you need

- Run `yarn` or `npm install` for installing dependencies
- Execute tests 
  - For mocks `yarn test:mock` or `npm run test:mock`
